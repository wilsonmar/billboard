Title: Display photos on TV (Electronic Billboard) from USB memory chip

Price: $99

Options: Power plug with chord $10 more. 

Description: 
This is the simplest way to show your pictures on a TV screen.

Images are rotated every 4 seconds.

1. Touch something metal to discharge static each time before you handle electronics.
2. On your PC or Mac, copy photos onto the USB memory chip (provided)
3. Plug the USB chip it in the USB port on the box.
3. Locate an open HDMI port on the back of the TV.
4. Switch input to that (blank screen will show).
5. Turn off the TV (so you can see the starting sequence).

6. Plug in the power cord from the box to the USB port on the TV.
7. If your TV doesn't have a USB plug, add the power cable option.
8. Insert the 3 foot HDMI cable (provided) to the TV.
9. Adjust the position of the box. (Some like the unit visible so they can see the red night light.)

0. Start the TV. The boot-up sequence scrolls by, then the program catalogs all photo files on the USB stick, which takes several minutes.
10. Enjoy!
